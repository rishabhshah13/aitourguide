You are currently on Abele Quad, named for Julian Abele, the renowned African-American architect who designed Duke's iconic, Gothic campus. Abele's designs embodied his vision of a student-centered campus and the Duke family's ideals of educating the whole person.


Navigate to the Abele Quad dedication plaque in the center of Abele Quad. From this vantage, you can see many of the key locations of interest on West Campus. In front of you is the Duke Chapel and a statue of James B. Duke, businessman, philanthropist, and founder of The Duke Endowment. To your right are academic and library buildings, including the entrance to the Duke School of Medicine; to your left are residence halls and student centers. Behind you is the primary West Campus bus stop, where visitors may take transportation to East Campus, home to Duke’s first-year students, as well as to other parts of the Duke campus and Medical Center.

Next, we will proceed to the Duke Chapel.




In the center of campus stands the Duke Chapel. This magnificent building was the vision of James B. Duke and is the arguably the most recognized symbol of the university. The chapel serves as a welcoming place for all faiths and offers many academic, religious, and social gatherings for students, faculty, and staff.


Constructed between 1930-1932, the Duke Chapel was the first building on West Campus that Julian Abele planned but the last of the original campus buildings to be constructed. The location of the chapel was selected by James B. Duke as it was the highest natural point on West Campus. Duke intended for the new West Campus to be constructed around the chapel.


Standing 210 feet tall, the Duke Chapel has a seating capacity of 1,800. The chapel is constructed of Indiana limestone and clad with iconic "Duke Stone" that comes from a local quarry. Inside, you'll find spectacular Neo-Gothic architecture, 77 beautiful stained glass windows (containing over 1 million pieces of glass in total), the 5,000 pipe Benjamin N. Duke Memorial Organ, two smaller pipe organs, the Memorial Chapel, and the crypt. Notable internments in the Duke Chapel are prominent members of the Duke family as well as many presidents of Duke University. And at the top of the chapel is the 50-bell carillon, which regularly plays weekdays at 5:00pm.

If the Chapel is open to visitors you may enjoy spending a few restful minutes inside; we ask that you be respectful of any services taking place. And in case you’re wondering, weddings are allowed in the Chapel for Duke alumni (but couples should know that a more recent tradition of camping to secure a wedding date has taken root in recent years).

Your next stop will be the Perkins, Rubenstein, and Bostock Libraries.


Primary university library spaces on West Campus housing millions of volumes with accessible and open spaces.



Officially the Harrington Engineering Quad (or "E-Quad" for short), this central quadrangle at the Pratt School of Engineering houses buildings, resources, and spaces for students to cultivate hands-on engineering knowledge and research. Duke offers majors in biomedical engineering, civil engineering, environmental engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering, and interdisciplinary options. It also offers minors energy engineering and machine learning and artificial intelligence.

On the east side of the E-Quad is the 322,000-square-foot Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering, Medicine and Allied Sciences (FCIEMAS). The Fitzpatrick Center includes extensive wet bench laboratories, a nanotechnology research and imaging facility, teaching labs and other lab support spaces, as well as Twinnie's Café.

Within this quad, students have access to spaces with new and emerging technologies that serve as creativity incubators. The Innovation Co-Lab is a perfect example of this, as these studios connect the Duke community with technology resources, programming, and knowledgeable staff to promote experimentation. Similarly, within the Levine Science Research Center (LSRC), the Design Pod provides an array of hand-, power- and rapid- prototyping tools that bring for first-year students who work together in teams to create solutions to real-world design challenges presented by community partners.

After you walk through the Engineering Quad, your next stop will be the Bryan Center and the area of campus known as ‘Campus Central'.



Constructed in 1982, the Bryan Center is home to a number of Student Affairs offices, student group and affinity spaces, theater operations, dining facilities, and the Duke University Store. This building serves as a popular location for student life and activity in Campus Center.

Within the Bryan Center are spaces for the Center for Multicultural Affairs (CMA), the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity (CSGD), and the Disability Cultural Center to name a few. The Bryan Center is also home to Duke theater operations and the Griffith Film Theater, the Sheafer Theater, and the Reynolds Theater.

The Bryan Center contains many flexible meeting spaces that are often used by Duke’s many student organizations. There are over 600 clubs and organizations on campus, ranging from performing arts to athletics to everything in between.

As you leave the Bryan Center, we you will stop by Duke’s new Student Wellness Center.


This 72,000-square-foot building opened in 2017 and underscores Duke’s commitment to student health and well-being. Serving as the first unified home for all student wellness units at Duke, the Wellness Center is home to Stu​dent Health, DukeReach, Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), DuWell, Nutrition Services, and physical therapy. The presence of both an on-campus pharmacy and a full dental clinic make Duke’s Student Wellness Center unique among many college and university health systems.

The Wellness Center hosts many activities for students including paint nights, mindfulness classes, and yoga. Understanding that holistic wellness is crucial to the success of the Duke Community, this center provides all students with exceptional care and coaching, guiding proactive wellness choices, assisting with health needs, and supporting the path to greater personal success and happiness.

This thoughtfully designed center offers lots of natural light and spacious seating to rest and recharge. Students have access to massage chairs and essential oil stations and can relax in the Murphy-Nimocks Meditation Garden. As an interesting note, all of the wood built within the building is from trees that used to stand where the building is now.

Return now to Campus Center now and walk to the Brodhead Center.


The Richard H. Brodhead Center for Campus Life serves as a hub for dining, community, and activity on campus. Originally named West Union, this building reopened in 2016 and was renamed in honor of Duke’s 9th President, Richard Brodhead. The building not only houses 14 eateries (nearly all of which are operated by Durham-based restaurateurs and chefs) but also boasts a second-floor teaching and demonstration kitchen that features guest chefs, cooking classes, and pop-up restaurants. With a dedication to sustainability and supporting the community, eateries use environmentally friendly tableware and utensils and provide diet-friendly options such as vegan, vegetarian, Kosher, Halal, and gluten-free.

Throughout the Brodhead Center are flexible gathering spaces that can be reserved for groups and organizations to work or just relax. This campus landmark honors the history of Duke University by blending the historic Gothic look with contemporary design that matches the innovative space.

Thanks to our unique and accommodating dining options coupled with flexible student meal plans, Duke has been ranked the #1 “Best College for Food in America” by DailyMeal for two consecutive years.

From Campus Center, you are walking into the West Campus Residential quad.


The beautiful Sarah P. Duke Gardens is not only a Durham community favorite, but also attracts more than 600,000 visitors annually from all over the world. In the heart of Duke University, the gardens’ 55 acres of specialized gardens provide opportunities for learning, inspiration, and enjoyment. The gardens’ world-class horticulture program has afforded it many awards and recognitions, including being voted “best place to take visitors from out of town" in a local magazine poll for 6 years in a row.

Serving the local community for over 80 years, Duke Gardens has developed dramatically and beautifully since the idea of a public garden arose in the early 1930s. The expansive gardens are divided into four different gardens: the Historic Gardens, the Doris Duke Center Gardens, the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, and the Culberson Asiatic Arboretum. Notable points of interest include the terrace overlook and koi pond, the Mary Duke Biddle rose garden, a carnivorous plant bog, the Japanese-style arched bridge, and a 36th parallel latitude marker.
